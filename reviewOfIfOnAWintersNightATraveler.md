# Review of Italo Calvino's _If on a Winter's Night a Traveler_

A fascinating novel which captures and keeps you in a continuosly changing mirage from the first words.
Of course, the ending couldn't be more twisted and unexpected and for sure it doesn't disappoint.
Not without a reason, recommended to be enjoyed together with a glass of wine.
