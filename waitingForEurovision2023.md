# Waiting for Eurovision 2023

All the 37 artists and their songs have been decided. The dates and times for the semifinals and the final have been selected. The hosting country and their dreams are ready: after imagining for 26 years that they won the Eurovision again, the UK can fantasize now that "it came home" again, even if only by offering to organize the event on behalf of Ukraine. The stage was designed. The semifinals and their running order are set. The presentors have been chosen. The comebacks in the competition of some previous participants (and even winners) have been planned and put into practice. 

Everything is ready! 

One question remains which is not _"Who will win?"_. But _"How easy it will be for Sweden to win?"_
