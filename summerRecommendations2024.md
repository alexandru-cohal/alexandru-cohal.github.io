# Summer Recommendations - 2024 Edition

## Books

During the long and hot summer days, some refreshing vibes are much needed. These can come in different shapes and colors, like a cold drink, a cold dish, a dip in the sea but also reading a Christmas related book!

There is no better time to catch up with the classic novels: _A Christmas Carol_ by Charles Dickens, _Skipping Christmas_ by John Grisham, _The 13th gift_ by Joanne Huist Smith, _The Nutcracker_ by E. T. A. Hoffmann. But also with some novels which combines the fiction with history like _The Autobiography of Santa Claus_ by Jeff Guinn.
  
There is also the option of short stories for those who cannot commit to longer readings between waves and napping sessions on the beach: _The Penguin Book of Christmas Stories_ edited by Jessica Harrison, _The Big Book of Christmas Mysteries_ edited by Otto Penzler.

Of course, there is life outside the Christmas period brought by the winter novels, which can make these sunny days to pass easier: _The Snow Child_ by Eowyn Ivey, _The Golden Compass_ by Philip Pullman.

## Sports

After the veritable football marathon containing over 80 matches from the _European Championship_ and _Copa Am√©rica_, a breath of fresh air was more than needed. And this year, this will come in the shape of the _Olympic Games_ from Paris. Interesting to watch, besides the classical and already settled sports, will be the newly introduced one, breaking (a style of street dance), and the ones who are returning after being introduced in the previous edition: skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing.
