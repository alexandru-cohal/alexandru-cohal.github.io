# The Eurovision 2023 Tattoo

Even though all good things must come to an end, this year's edition of Eurovision did it in a way which will stuck like a tattoo in the fans' memories. As expected, Sweden shown that this was their time to meet again with the trophy, but it wasn't as easy as expected. With a completely different style, aiming at opposite state of mind and feelings, Finland tried to find a way and hoped that the stars will align for them. They were a tough competitor which attracted most of the public votes but couldn't touch many of the jury votes, which tilted the balance towards their neighbours. 

Twelve years after she felt the first euphoria of winning the Eurovision, Loreen decided to walk through fire and through rain one more time and to put her heart into public's hands. Her song was the power of a unicorn needed by a final to shine, a final with more acts than usual which will not pass the test of time, the violins will stop playing and even the angels will stop crying. 

As usual, the Eurovision songs can be split into 3 main categories. There are the ones which are impressive in a positive way. Besides Sweden and Finland, the trio composed of Moldova, Australia and the Czech Republic perfectly summarizes the current global worries: war, love and marriage. Afterwards, there are the songs which are impressive in a negative way. The UK, Germany and Croatia gave us three important life lessons. It is very hard to go up and be very close to win but it takes almost no time to fall back down. When you try to cover the lack of taste with blood and glitter, it will not work for sure. But when you realize that you don't have any chance in a competition, at least you should have a good day and to enjoy it in your own weird way. Finally, there are, sadly, the acts which leave no impression at all. No need for any enumeration here, because this article will turn into an incantation.
