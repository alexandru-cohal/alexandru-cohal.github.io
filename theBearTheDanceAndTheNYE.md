# The bear, the dance and the New Year's Eve

Hosting the largest population of bears in Europe, Romania couldn’t have as the main symbol of the New Year’s Eve traditions a different animal. And what does a bear usually do when the end of the year is approaching? Dancing to the rhythms of drums, of course! However, as we are not anymore in the medieval times, the bear is not a real one with sacred healing powers which was taught to walk like a human. But an all-year-long trained dancer wearing a costume which resembles a bear. Or many times, an outfit made of what used to be a real bear at some point. So… the medieval times maybe are not totally over.

However, this is not a one-bear-show. Many times, there are multiple bears involved or other dancers wearing masks which represent different types of people, personalities and social classes. And there are, of course, the drummers and the singers. “Singers” is a bit too much, they should be rather called “shouters”. But what matters is that they are telling a satirical story of the current times. The actual dance of the bear is not a complicated routine, just slow and strong movements, exactly what a real bear does. The meaning of these unhurried moves can be seen in two ways: the representation of relaxation, freedom and possession of all the time in the world or the depiction of pain, suffer and burden of the difficulty of current times. But the scope of this whole show is to make as much noise as possible in order to scare the evil spirits and to celebrate the end of a year with is ups and downs and the start of a new story.

Different regions of the country have variations of this tradition involving different main characters like goats, deer, devils, doctors, policemen, “the ugly one”, “the beautiful one” and many other real or less real creatures, depending on the legends in which you believe in. And if there weren’t already plenty of versions of this tradition already, there are also distinct dances for different age groups: children, adolescents and adults. But the classic version has the bear in the center and is originating from the northeastern part of Romanian, Moldova, where also competitions and festivals are organized for choosing the best dance. This tradition is actually on the UNESCO waiting list to be officially recognized and protected.

Exactly how the real bears can be spotted in Romania more and more often inside the mountain villages and towns, also this tradition was adapted for the modern fast-paced life. The dancing bears can be seen now in the public transport, performing a show short enough in order to fit between two stops. Also, the costume was updated accordingly. A one-piece bear style pyjama having also a hoodie with ears is now often used. Is this the same as the original version? For sure not, but at least the tradition survives, one way or another.

Side note: As you already noticed, the bears are an important part of the Romanian culture. This is why WWF Romania created the _Bearflix_ platform. In exchange for the subscriptions which are used for supporting the only European bear cubs orphanage, access to videos showing the daily life of the little bears is given.
