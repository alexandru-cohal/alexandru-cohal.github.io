# New Year's Eve Superstitions in Romania

An important event like the New Year's Eve fueled the Romanians' imaginations and many superstitions were created and kept. There are even some superstitions particular for some regions, due to historical and geographical reasons. Though, the ones which are valid for the whole country are focused on three main topics: prosperity, good luck and health. Why exactly these topics? It is a long and complicated story.

On the New Year's Eve it is not recommended to clean the house nor to throw away items from the house, not even the garbage. Otherwise, the prosperity will be also removed and the house will become empty. When it comes to money, the rule is simple: keep only your own money close to yourself. You should return all the borrowed money, keep some of your own money in your pocket and do not lend money to anyone. This way, you will not have many debts and you will not be poor.

In order to have good luck, a person should wear new clothes, preferably red because this is the color of happiness and love (it can be assumed a priori that for Romanians, the equation _Happiness + Love = Good Luck_ is always true).

Being healthy in the new year is simple. You should eat an apple on the last day of the year and everything is solved. This is because if the Romanians would follow ad litteram the proverb "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", there wouldn't be anything left to make one of the types of PÄƒlinca, a spirit similar to the Spanish Orujo.

For Romanians, the superstitions are not ending when the new year starts. The first day of the year was also very fruitful for this kind of inventions. Though, all of them can be summed up by saying that whatever you will do on the first day, you will do for the whole year. Plus some extra bad luck if you will talk about phantoms and dead people (because, of course, the legend of Dracula was not randomly placed in Romania).
