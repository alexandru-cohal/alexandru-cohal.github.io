# ITKS Mystery Series

Everyone loves a good mystery series. That's a fact. This is why it was about the time to have our very own ITKS office-made series in which we will try to solve some real life enigmas. In each episode a breathtaking case will be presented. The same as during a real investigation, there are multiple detectives involved, each of them following different leads and reaching to different conclusions. We will present you all of these outcomes but we need your help! We want you to analyze carefuylly all of them and choose the most plausible one. Once you have it, look for the post with the _#ITKSMystery_ post from the _Events_ Teams channel and vote with the appropiate emoji. Each vote is important, so choose wisely! 

Enough <s>talking</s> writing so let's get started with our first mystery.

## Episode 1: Sh*t happens. Literally.

7th of March 2024. Morning. Many of us are slowly going towards the office, thinking about what type of cereals to devour before writing some lines of code. Business as usual. When getting next to the office, on the side of the building which usually greets you with a roasted coffee smell, an image taken from the worst horror movies (or from the worst posts of the _Kitchen and Men Toilet_ Teams channel) appears. You see it. Your brain stops for a moment. Suddenly one thousands thoughts cluster into your mind. Can it really be what it looks like? That would be impossible! Or maybe...  

### Investigation 1: Dinosaurs are back!
