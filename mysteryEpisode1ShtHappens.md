# ITKS Mystery Series

Everyone loves a good mystery series. That's a fact. This is why it was about time to have our very own ITKS office-made series in which we will try to solve some real-life enigmas. In each episode, a breathtaking (at least in our opinion) case will be presented. 

Sometimes there are multiple detectives competing and trying to wrap-up a case following different leads. This is also our situation (tracking bugs in the code and cockroaches in the garage is not challenging anymore). We will present you the outcomes of all the investigations, but we need your help! We want you to carefully analyze all of them and choose the best one (based on your own detective guidelines). Once you have it, look for the post with the _#ITKSMystery_ tag from the _ITK Spain - Events_ Teams channel and vote with the appropriate emoji. Each vote is important, so choose wisely! 

Enough <s>talking</s> writing so let's get started with our first mystery.

## Episode 1: Sh*t happens

7th of March 2024. Morning. Many of us are slowly going towards the office, thinking about what type of cereals to devour before writing some lines of code. Business as usual. When arriving next to the office, on the side of the building which usually greets you with an over-roasted coffee smell, an image taken from the worst horror movies (or from the worst posts of the Kitchen and Men Toilet Teams channel) appears. You see it. Your brain stops for a moment. Suddenly one thousand thoughts cluster into your mind. Can it really be what it looks like? That would be impossible! Or maybe...   

### Investigation: Dinosaurs are back! Actually they were never gone...

_"That's so rude... To tell straight to my face that all of us disappeared 65 million years ago... Not 1 million, not 2 millions but exactly 65! Pfff... And when they go back home every evening after work, saying that they are going to have some 'Me time', they stop talking and giving life signs to anyone else and just stare at the TV for hours, it is normal. And of course that no fish, no bird nor any mammal is going the next day to write in the newspapers 'The humans disappeared! Mass extinction!'. But they did this to us! When we actually just went to hibernate for some time because some loonatic announced on our TV and our social media that an asteroid is going to hit the planet, an ice age is coming, volcanos will erupt or some click-bait story like that. Fools... And now when they see us on the streets or in the parks, they think that we are some other humans wearing some costumes for getting some coins or entertaining the kids... Pfff... Wow, I should stop drinking that much when I go out to Razzmatazz because I talk too much out loud on the streets when I am alone... I should get home faster to catch some hours of sleep. I still have so much to walk and I am so tired... And I really need to go to the toilet. Having toilets either for men and women is such a limitation... I should call a taxi. No, not a good idea, the driver will start again the '65 million years' topic. These humans... I should better pick up a bike. Or no, better one of those mopeds, then I will not have the same issue with my short legs like last time, when I couldn't reach the pedals and the people were making fun of me. Again, these humans... Here is one! But it's purple! Bleah! Couldn't be green like my pretty skin? I really need to go to the toilet... Cabify? I don't have this app... Ok, I will install it. No internet, great! They are flying to Mars and to the Moon but they cannot put a proper antenna in this city... Now it's working! But now I have to scan a QR code... I cannot resist any longer... Is there any toilet around here? Or at least a bush! Great, not even bushes around... No, no, nooo!... And I was complaining before that the purple color didn't fit well to that moped... I should run away now, before someone will see me! Arghhh... Of course that this amazing invention had to fall down and to make a bang so loud that even my dead relatives from the museums woke up... Who cares? I should get going from here... Humans..."_
