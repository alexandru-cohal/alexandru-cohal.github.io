# ITKS Mystery Series

Everyone loves a good mystery series. That's a fact. This is why it was about time to have our very own ITKS office-made series in which we will try to solve some real-life enigmas. In each episode, a breathtaking (at least in our opinion) case will be presented. 

Sometimes there are multiple detectives competing and trying to wrap-up a case following different leads. This is also our situation (tracking bugs in the code and cockroaches in the garage is not challenging anymore). We will present you the outcomes of all the investigations, but we need your help! We want you to carefully analyze all of them and choose the best one (based on your own detective guidelines). Once you have it, look for the post with the _#ITKSMystery_ tag from the _ITK Spain - Events_ Teams channel and vote with the appropriate emoji. Each vote is important, so choose wisely! 

Enough <s>talking</s> writing so let's get started with our first mystery.

## Episode 1: Sh*t happens. Literally.

7th of March 2024. Morning. Many of us are slowly going towards the office, thinking about what type of cereals to devour before writing some lines of code. Business as usual. When arriving next to the office, on the side of the building which usually greets you with an over-roasted coffee smell, an image taken from the worst horror movies (or from the worst posts of the Kitchen and Men Toilet Teams channel) appears. You see it. Your brain stops for a moment. Suddenly one thousand thoughts cluster into your mind. Can it really be what it looks like? That would be impossible! Or maybe...   

### Investigation: Dinosaurs are back!
