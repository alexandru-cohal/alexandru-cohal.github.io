# cASR Workshop

Based on the discussion from the ITKS All Hands Meetings, it is better if we start this article with the following section.

## Glossary
- cASR = Classic AUTOSAR
- AUTOSAR = AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture
- Lake = the leitmotif of this trip as everything revolved around Bilal's wish to see one of the lakes around Holzkirchen

Now that the stage is set, let's start with the stories.

Exactly what December means for the Christmas lovers, June was the same for the ITK employees passionate about the Classic AUTOSAR topic. Why? Because the first edition of the cASR Workshop took place in the office from Holzkirchen, Germany. Around 40 persons from different offices from Germany, Austria and Spain gathered together for 3 days in order to discuss about 10 different topics which are considered to be the future of the next Classic AUTOSAR projects within ITK.  

(Many hours spent on get to know each other activities, presentations, discussions, hands-on tasks, brainstorming - Energy from the office BBQ (I see a pattern here), German food and drinks in the office (after the end of the working times, of course), in a nearby biergarten and also in the hotel's restaurant - A bartender with a mood changing as fast as the weather during those days, felt like an after workshop - many of the participants, different topics, technical and non-technical

After the workshop, the 8 of us who participated at this event split: 4 of us, with Bilal in the lead, went to see one of the lakes around Holzkirchen before getting to the airport and returning to Barcelona, and the other 4 of us started the long weekend in a very nice house next to (surprise!) another lake between Holzkirchen and Munich.

It was a very entertaining end of the week, very diverse: 
- baklavas
- seeing the Scottish supporters having a lot of fun all around Munich, especially in a brewery where they were continuosly singing and drinking liters and liters of beer
- watching the opening match of the European Football Championship in a vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant
- climbing inside the Bavaria statue and having a very philosophycal discussion between us inside the statue's head
