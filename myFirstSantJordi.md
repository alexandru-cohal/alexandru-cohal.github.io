# My First Sant Jordi

After missing the last year's Sant Jordi because of a confusion due to the overwhelming amount of celebrations from Barcelona, Catalunia and Spain, this year I had the first experience of this event. It was a very interesting day with which I could close the circle after visiting some months ago the town of Montblanc, the place where the legend says that Sant Jordi defeated the dragon.

Even more, I had the opportunity to compare the Barcelona's Sant Jordi with Madrid's DÃ­a del Libro, celebrated on the Friday before, but there is no doubt which event was more popular, more attractive, with more passion, endless hours of waiting and sometimes desperation involved. From the moment when I stepped out of the train at the Sants station, I could see what this day means by the huge amount of people with books and roses in their hands. If I was impressed with the crowds from the train station, when I got to the center of Barcelona, the situation became from another world. There was a sea of people, but one of those unpredictable and agitated seas which would have scared even Columbus after his well-known voyages. I was pleasantly surprised, though a bit scared, to be honest, to see such a huge interest and sometimes desperation for books and for reading, in general. I only hope that this passion is maintained all year long for most of the persons present and it is not just another reason for getting some more Likes on the social media platforms.

Even though the day ended for me without buying any book, as the offer was pretty limited for the non-Catalan and non-Spanish readers, I got as a souvenir the extra motivation to continue improving my Spanish skills such that already from the next edition, to be able to get something, even if it is just a Mafalda comic.
