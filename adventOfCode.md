# Advent of Code

Now that the summer season and its vacation period are over, we have to start looking forward and crossing the days from the calendar for the next major event: Christmas.
 
Because for us, Software Developers, everything has to be a little bit different, even the Advent period has to have some lines of code involved. So this is why the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event was created. Starting from the 1st of December, for 25 consecutive days, one challenge is proposed every day. If the challenge is solved correctly, a golden star is given as a reward.  Similar to opening a small door every day from an Advent calendar and getting a chocolate as a reward, right?
 
However, there is a trick (nothing is straightforward in the world of programmers): Each daily challenge has 2 parts. The first part is usually pretty fast and easy to solve. But the second part usually requires a slight modification or optimization on top of what has been already done. Or in the worst case scenario, a complete new strategy and an implementation from scratch is needed. This depends on how generic the implementation of the first part was, how well the second part was anticipated and on the mercy of the Christmas elves. But the good part is that even if only the first part is solved, a smaller reward is still given: a silver star.
 
The Christmas days are in general, a period of relaxation and of returning home, to the family but also a period when maybe new decorations or new recipes are tried. The same is for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): you can return to your favorite programming language, the one which always feels cozy and comfortable, or you can try something more exotic, something which you've always wanted to play with but you didn't have time nor energy. In the end, what matters, is to provide the answers to each challenge in a small text-box from the website.
 
And until programming will be introduced in the Olympic games, this event has its own ranking and its own professionals. This can be seen in the general leaderboard, which takes into account how fast the answers were submitted. But for a more cozy atmosphere, private leaderboards can be created. And there, only the persons who are joining you for the Christmas dinner can be invited.
 
If a daily challenge is missed due to the Christmas preparations, or if the idea for solving it comes later, while having a glass of Mulled Wine, the opportunity to get the silver or the golden star is not missed completely. It is still possible, only that the penalty for solving it later will drag you down in the ranking. At least you can still show off with your stars and with the overall yearly image which uncovers step by step, with each golden star obtained.

If you are now convinced to prepare this year for Christmas  in a different way, you can join our private leaderboard on [this](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private) page, using the code _1071281-1f7f9d00_, and also join our discussions during the office coffee breaks. Have fun and Merry Christmas! üéÖüéÑüéÅ‚ùÑÔ∏è
