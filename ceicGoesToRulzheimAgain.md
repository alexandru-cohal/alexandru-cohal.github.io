# CEIC goes to Rülzheim. Again.

With only one month before the CEIC project's second year celebration, it was the time for the second face-to-face workshop. Six out of its nine team members said "Yes" to the travelling invitation to the already known territory of Rülzheim and to join the technical and retrospective meetings (or to start a rock band?).

The three days were filled not only with technical details but also with:
- driving adventures (the legend says that both Abel and Arturo are still driving now, the first one going around the Technical Museum from Speyer trying to find a parking and the second one trying to get to the supermarket which is only 2 minutes away from the ITK office) 
- typical German food (are the Pommes the national German dish? It's a tough competition against the Döner, so let's leave the fight open)
- non-German restaurants (the discovery of the trip: a surprisingly good Greek restaurant from an area of Karlsruhe where you would rather expect to see happening in front of your eyes a scene from a crime series)
- unusual places to eat (opening a huge door of the meeting <s>room</s> <s>hall</s> dome and using a professional grill for having a BBQ shows another level of organization and of choosing the priorities when setting-up an office building)
- (many points so far were related to food, so let's move on to something else)
- life revelations (the answer to life, the universe, and everything should be updated from _"42"_ to _"Yes, normal debit cards saved on the phone can be used at the ITK canteen"_)
- live music (the echo of a whistling tune during a meeting )
- rain (something quite suprising for us, based on the last months from Barcelona, but not enough in order to start singing in the rain)
- another failed attempt to visit the Speyer Cathedral (is this place ever open or is it just a myth?)
- delays (of course, how would a trip be without a delay? This time it was not due to the "super precise" public transportation system but to Eurowings' extra verifications of the plane. Mercedes-Benz (the client of the CEIC project) do you hear this? Next time when a Merge Request will be delivered one hour later, please don't be angry :) )
- a surreal hotel (located literally at the end of a country road, with a river flowing under it, horses peacefully moving around, locked room heaters at 17°C, a tablet in each room for accessing the internet and streaming services with personalized welcome messages containing our own names - Brrr, a bit scary in my opinion)
- (mini) sports
- loss of hopes and dreams (the moment when we will have our travel expenses approved in BTravel seems to move further and further away with every click, rejection and failure to get a complete invoice from the hotel).

Will there be a third face-to-face workshop? Probably yes. Will it be as entertaining as this one? That's for sure!
