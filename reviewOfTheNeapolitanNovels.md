# Review of the _Neapolitan Novels_ written by Elena Ferrante

Not being part of the "Netflix generation", my mother really wanted some years ago to watch on one of the Romanian TV channels the series made after Elena Ferrante's _Neapolitan Novels_, after enjoying reading all the volumes. Seeing her dedication to be ready in front of the TV several weeks in a row, on the same day and at the same time, after perfectly synchronizing everything she had to do, my interest in also watching this series grew as fast as a clown can inflate a balloon. Only that the balloon didn’t break because the topic of the series was not as good as I expected but because it was much better. So, I decided after some minutes to not give spoilers to myself, stop watching and read the novels. Only that this desire was rapidly forgotten in that specific dark corner of the mind which each of us has and is using for storing those intentions of things to do which very rarely end up seeing the sunlight again.

However, this idea came back to life when I read Eulàlia's review of the first volume from the Summer 2022 issue of the ITKS Newsletter. I challenged myself at that time to read the series "now or never", having the extra motivation that there is another reader having the same challenge. It was a very engaging journey to sail through all the volumes during which I rediscovered the pleasure of travelling alone, I visited for the first time two amazing libraries from Barcelona, I celebrated my 30th birthday and I was joined by many glasses of wine and beer in cozy cafés, bars, beaches or simply at my place.

The whole series was impressive due to the produced attraction which kept me focused with very few stale moments. Even more impressive when considering that the series has four consistent volumes of over 400 pages each. Nevertheless, I consider that with these novels, Elena Ferrante mastered the way of ending the chapters. The suspense created every single time, not only motivated me countless times to read one more chapter and then another one and another one, but also made me leave the book down from my hands in the middle of the chapters, an unusual habit for any reader. The story of the two protagonists shows how complicated the life can be even when only a handful of people are interacting with each other. It is a highly recommended series of novels for giving yourself the chance to rediscover and to appreciate more your own self and what you have.
