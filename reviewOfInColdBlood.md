# Review of Truman Capote's _In Cold Blood_

A very well constructed true crime novel, with an impressive amount of details about the lives of everyone involved. Maybe sometimes too detailed, as I had many times flashbacks that I am reading again "One hundred years of solitude". Nevertheless, it is totally understandable why this novel has its place in the history of literature.

**3** stars out of **5**
