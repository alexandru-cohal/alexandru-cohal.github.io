# Table Tennis @ ITKS

Which outdoor activity can be organized with seven persons? If you are thinking about singing the "Heigh-Ho" song like the seven dwarves from the story of Snow White, this is not the expected answer (even though it would be pretty cool :slightly_smiling_face:). A table tennis game was established between some of the "inhabitants" of one of the loudest but also the coolest office rooms of ITKS :wink:. We used one table tennis table from _Parc del Port Ol√≠mpic_ during a late October evening, still warm enough for wearing shorts and T-shirts.

Even though the number of participants was not the best one, this didn't stop us from being creative. On top of the classic 2 vs. 2 matches where one member of the winning team was staying at the table while the other three players were changing, improvised trick games were invented ad-hoc and played on the side by the ones who were waiting. In the end of the event, a rotation 1 vs. 1 game was played by all of us, where each player was supposed to hit the ball and then run on the other side of the table when her/his turn was coming. Although it was pretty confusing due to the constant changes of the sides, this game was by far the most interesting one. The same opinion was shared also by the mosquitos of the neighbourhood which were attracted either by our shouts and cheers or by the street light which was shining exactly above the table (nobody will ever know the true reason, we were too concetrated on the game in order to start a chit-chat with them).

During the event we even had a presentation of the _Middle Axis Theorem_! Contrary to the enthusiasm of the presenter (which is also the official ITKS Master of Riddles), this theorem was received with pretty cold reactions, maybe because of the temperature after the sunset :slightly_smiling_face:.

Next time when we will organize a similar event, we have to learn how to mark our territory around the group of two table tennis tables and to not give up so easily when some other players from the neighborhood are showing up. We will also try to extend the invitation to the whole office (even if we usually go for the coffee breaks in an RTA pack like the wolves, we like the people from the other teams :slightly_smiling_face:), so more persons could enjoy _Table Tennis @ ITKS_.
